Integration? merge
automated process
devops: development + operations: its a way of doing work or the method of performing some kind of things
devops who actually does half part of the development and half part of the operations and bring up something in the middle
because of devops the sw release is becoming very efficient and quick
tools we use:
Jenkins, circle ci etc
Jenkins: is an automation tool which provides you an automation process or it helps to automate all different kind of
 stuffs.
 Two tools:
 Maven: Its a build(single file) automation tool.Its a dependency management tool so whatever we need in our project, it automatically downloads for us.
 which helps you to bundle your project into one single jar.
 Gradle


 .jar: java archive--> whole piece of code will be deployed to the server in one single file
 .war: web application archive

 code--> .jar file--> installed on server
 If any piece of code is bundled into something using maven, at the end it says build success.
 githubcode------> maven---->build(bundled your code into jar file)--->test--->QA--->staging env--->production
 install jenkins
 crown job: which you can schedule a job depending upon what time, what date, what sec. Its kind of scheduler kind of stuff.
 eg. min, hour, day, month,day(week)
