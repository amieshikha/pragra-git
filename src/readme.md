-) 4th class: 23 March 2024 (Saturday)
# Recap: (Tuesday)
1. Variables
2. Data Types-- 
type of data
 primitive , non primitive

Initialization, Declaration, Scope of class
---> scanner, switch case, break, default ..

-) 5th class: 26 March 2024 (Tuesday)
# Recap: (Saturday)

1. Operators, Its Types:Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison , Logical
practical: sum,modulus,swapping
2. Decision-making statements: if else

-) 7th class: 30 March 2024 (Saturday)
# Recap: (Tuesday)
1. Scanner
2. switch: case, break, default
--> Loops- while, do while, for loop
break--> break the iteration
continue--> skip the iteration.

-) 8th class: 2 April 2024 (Tuesday)
# Recap (Saturday)
1. Loops
2. break, continue
--> Class and objects, types, parameters, arguments 
--> Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method declaration. 
--> Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked. 
--> (Logical entity)Class is collection of objects, variables and methods
--> Class is a template or a blueprint for creating Objects, and it defines the attributes and behaviours of objects of a certain type.
--> (Physical existence) Object is a variable of type class. 2 types: Primitive, Non-Primitive
--> Object is an Instance of a Class, representing a real-world entity with its behaviour and state.
--> Method is set of block of statements which executes a specific task
--> new keyword will allocate memory to objects.
--> to call the method we need to use object reference

# Recap: (Tuesday)
Class and Object ?
methods , parameter and arguments
-- >Constructor is a special kind of method
which initialize the object
--)no return type --)no even void
-- >types of const
default
parameterized const
this keyword-> helps you to give reference to current class
method overloading--> same name but different parameters

-) 11th class: 9 April 2024 (Tuesday)
# Recap
Constructors ? types

this keyword

method overloading

--> JVM , JRE, JDK
JVM ----> virtual machine creates byte code

JVM is machine dependent

Memory
Stack and Heap memory

Variables
Local variable
Instance variable
static variable
Static
variables
static method
static block
static nested class (later)
variable
static variable could refer to the common property of all the objects. for example

Phone Android , Samsung, Lg, oneplus, Motorolla

static method
static methods can not use non static data members. this and super cannot be used in static context.

static context -- non static context.

UNIX
-) 13th class: 13 April 2024 (Saturday)

# JDK, JVM, JRE
Memory management, Stack vs Heap, constructor chaining, static variables, method, block, nesting
static method?
why main is static?
--> String
#  Arrays
# Types of arrays:
Single Dimensional, Multi-Dimensional

-) 14th class: 16 April 2024(Tuesday)

Arrays Collection of similar data type

types

Single dim.
multi dim.
Strings
--> == --> to check compare, check reference
--> .equals()--> to check the value, check contents only
Immutable ? why?--> cannot change the value of string
Types:
Literals,
String object-> new
foreach loop used for simplicity

Heap ---> String constant pool

String obj ------> Heap (non SCP )

String vs StringBuffer Vs StringBuilder

Mutable strings

StringBuffer
StringBuilder
StringBuffer [1.0] StringBuilder

Mutable Mutable
Thread Safe (synchronized) non thread safe (non - synchronized)
thread safe - not allow multithreading

ATM ---->

thread -- a small process.

======================== Object Oriented Paradigm [OOPs]
functional programming --- functions are first class citizen.

OOP -- object are first class citizen

Objects Classes

4 pillars of OOP.

Inheritance ================== iphone 10 -- Face id , camera , iphone 15 -- face id, enchaced camera, dynamic island.
one class inherits from the other class properties and behaviour

A variables, methods etc... | B inherit from A class.

A ----> Parent class/ Super class / Base class | B -----> Child Class / Derived class/ Sub class

Encapsulation ==================== Data hiding, wrapping up the data in single unit.

Polymorphism - many forms.

method overloading.... method overriding....

method overloading vs overriding.

sum(int a) sum (int a, int b)

Abstraction
Abstract ? showing only essential features but internal details/complexity.

encapsulation                    abstraction
hiding everything                showing neccessary details

=========================== Access Modifiers
private --- accessed within the class only // your wifi.
public --- access anywhere. // starbucks wifi
protected -- after inheritance
default -- no keyword
==================== Object
every class in Java has a super class called as Object You created it or created by Java

15th class: 18 April 2024( Thursday)
 UNIX

16th class: 20 April 2024( Saturday)

OOPs
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Abstraction
create Object of RBC, Scotia , TD etc...

IS-A relationship (Car is a vehicle ) (ScotiaBank is a Bank )

Aggregation

Has-A relationship Employee has Address

Encapsulation
wrapping of data into single unit control your data

final ?
final variables ---- > constant final method ----- > You can not inherit the method final Class ----- > Can not be extended

how to make immutable class ?

Polymorphism
Abtraction
