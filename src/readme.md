# Agile SD;> Flexibility, everything we do, has to be done in small chunks
Drawback in  waterfall is consumption of time as in wm it takes years and in agile it takes 2- 3 weeks.
We resolved that drawback with the help of Agile model.
# Backlog: 
List of all the tasks

# Sprint: 2 weeks of timing in Agile

Meetings?
Daily Stand up --  15 - 30 minutes{ daily updates, what we did yesterday, what we are going to do today or any blocker}
# Before the start of sprint
Sprint planning--  30- 60 minutes [Jira]{ What task we need to  bring to the sprint} 
# After the end of sprint
Sprint Retro:
What went well
What went wrong
Any learning
What we can try next.

# Recap: (Tuesday)
1. Variables
2. Data Types-- 
type of data
 primitive , non primitive
3. Comments: Single line: ctrl + shift+ forward slash
             MultiLine: ctlr+ forward slash 
4. + operator--> Overloaded operator in java
5. Concatenate-> Joining two strings
6. naming conventions:
class --> first letter should be upper case
camel casing?
7. variable name, method/function --> first letter should be small, next is camel casing

Initialization, Declaration, Scope of class
---> scanner, switch case, break, default ..

1. Scanner
2. switch: case, break, default
--> Loops- while, do while, for loop
break--> break the iteration
continue--> skip the iteration.

# Recap (Saturday)
1. Loops
2. break, continue
--> Class and objects, types, parameters, arguments 
--> Parameters refers to the list of variables in a method declaration. 
--> Arguments are the actual values that are passed in when the method is invoked. 
--> (Logical entity)Class is collection of objects, variables and methods
--> Class is a template or a blueprint for creating Objects, and it defines the attributes and behaviours of objects of a certain type.
--> (Physical existence) Object is a variable of type class. 2 types: Primitive, Non-Primitive
--> Object is an Instance of a Class, representing a real-world entity with its behaviour and state.
--> Method is set of block of statements which executes a specific task
--> new keyword will allocate memory to objects.
--> to call the method we need to use object reference

# Recap: (Tuesday)
Class and Object ?
methods , parameter and arguments
-- >Constructor is a special kind of method
which initialize the object
--)no return type --)no even void
-- >types of const
default
parameterized const
this keyword-> helps you to give reference to current class
method overloading--> same name but different parameters

-) 11th class: 9 April 2024 (Tuesday)
# Recap
Constructors ? types

this keyword

method overloading

--> JVM , JRE, JDK
JVM ----> virtual machine creates byte code

JVM is machine dependent

Memory
Stack and Heap memory

Variables
Local variable
Instance variable
static variable
Static
variables
static method
static block
static nested class (later)
variable
static variable could refer to the common property of all the objects. for example

Phone Android , Samsung, Lg, oneplus, Motorolla

static method
static methods can not use non static data members. this and super cannot be used in static context.

static context -- non static context.

UNIX
-) 13th class: 13 April 2024 (Saturday)

# JDK, JVM, JRE
Memory management, Stack vs Heap, constructor chaining, static variables, method, block, nesting
static method?
why main is static?
--> String
#  Arrays
# Types of arrays:
Single Dimensional, Multi-Dimensional

-) 14th class: 16 April 2024(Tuesday)

Arrays Collection of similar data type

types

Single dim.
multi dim.
Strings
--> == --> to check compare, check reference
--> .equals()--> to check the value, check contents only
Immutable ? why?--> cannot change the value of string
Types:
Literals,
String object-> new
foreach loop used for simplicity

Heap ---> String constant pool

String obj ------> Heap (non SCP )

String vs StringBuffer Vs StringBuilder

Mutable strings

StringBuffer
StringBuilder
StringBuffer [1.0] StringBuilder

Mutable Mutable
Thread Safe (synchronized) non thread safe (non - synchronized)
thread safe - not allow multithreading

ATM ---->

thread -- a small process.

======================== Object Oriented Paradigm [OOPs]
functional programming --- functions are first class citizen.

OOP -- object are first class citizen

Objects Classes

4 pillars of OOP.

Inheritance ================== iphone 10 -- Face id , camera , iphone 15 -- face id, enchaced camera, dynamic island.
one class inherits from the other class properties and behaviour

A variables, methods etc... | B inherit from A class.

A ----> Parent class/ Super class / Base class | B -----> Child Class / Derived class/ Sub class

Encapsulation ==================== Data hiding, wrapping up the data in single unit.

Polymorphism - many forms.

method overloading.... method overriding....

method overloading vs overriding.

sum(int a) sum (int a, int b)

Abstraction
Abstract ? showing only essential features but internal details/complexity.

encapsulation                    abstraction
hiding everything                showing neccessary details

=========================== Access Modifiers
private --- accessed within the class only // your wifi.
public --- access anywhere. // starbucks wifi
protected -- after inheritance
default -- no keyword
==================== Object
every class in Java has a super class called as Object You created it or created by Java

15th class: 18 April 2024( Thursday)
 UNIX

16th class: 20 April 2024( Saturday)

OOPs
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Abstraction
create Object of RBC, Scotia , TD etc...

IS-A relationship (Car is a vehicle ) (ScotiaBank is a Bank )

Aggregation

Has-A relationship Employee has Address

Encapsulation
wrapping of data into single unit control your data

final ?
final variables ---- > constant final method ----- > You can not inherit the method final Class ----- > Can not be extended

how to make immutable class ?

Polymorphism
Abtraction

Collection: List: Linked List, Array List
read/ search: arrayList
delete/update:linkedlist
super class of all the classes is object
super class for collection is iterable
iterator<>
collections: that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Maven: Its a build tool
Map: Map has its own hierarchy.Map is a data structure but its not a part of collection.
In collection you only have a singular data structure, Map will be having a Key value pair based structure.
characteristics of map: in key it has to be unique
characteristics of map is implemented by hashmap
Map is an interface.Its a data structure which stores value in key value pair based data where key is supposed to be 
unique, value can be duplicated.
Hash map literally implements all the methods in map
in this we use put and get methods to add and retrieve data
uses generics 
Internal implementation of hash map: ArrayList of LinkedList of node: AL<>LL<>node
node: [hash code, Key , Value, Address of next node]
Hash code: is an integer number [mathematical calculation]
steps:
1.calculate hash code eg. 5522
2.calculate index
3.go to 4th index
4.create next node
if already existed then ist compare hash code
after boolean its the cheapest opeartion
if key is true then upgrade the value
null is allowed in hash maps only
Two variables affect:
one is size
2nd is load factor is between (o, 1) by default its 0.60
in the hash set , all the values are null always.
25th Class: 14 May 2024 (Tuesday)
Singleton design pattern
18 Saturday
regex101: regular expression, apache, tomget
concurrent hashmap(if we have a retrieval, heavy operations,
hashtable ()--> if you are looking for all sort of operations
in array: copyonwritearraylist<>
threadsafety:when you need to modify, non thread safety
java 1.8: features: lambda expressions, fuctional Interfaces
applications: streams API, Date time API, optional classes, etc
:: Operator
-->   Lambda expression-> having one abstract method and no need of annotation
