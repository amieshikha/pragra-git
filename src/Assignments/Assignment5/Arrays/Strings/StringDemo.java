/*
Create a program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
Develop a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Write a Java program that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of words in it. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The program should maintain the order of characters within each word.
For example:

Input: "Hello World" Output: "World Hello"

Input: "Java Programming is Fun" Output: "Fun is Programming Java"
