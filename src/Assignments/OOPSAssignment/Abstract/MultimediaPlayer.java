//Problem: Develop a multimedia player system that supports playing [audio], [video], and [displaying images].
// The system should consist of the following components:abstract class
//[MediaDevice]: An abstract class representing a generic media device.
// It should have a [name] field and a method [void displayDetails()] to display details about the device.
//class [AudioPlayer]: A class representing an audio player, which is a subclass of MediaDevice and implements the [Playable] interface.
// It should have fields for the [song name] and [artist].
// The [play()] method should play the audio, and [displayDetails()] should display details about the audio player.
//VideoPlayer: Another class representing a video player, which is a subclass of MediaDevice and implements the Playable interface.
// It should have fields for the video title and duration.
// The play() method should play the video, and displayDetails() should display details about the video player.
// ImageDisplay: A class representing an image display device, which is a subclass of MediaDevice.
// It should have fields for the image name and resolution.
// The displayImage() method should display the image, and displayDetails() should display details about the image display device.
// Write a Java program to implement the multimedia player system.
// Create instances of AudioPlayer,VideoPlayer and ImageDisplay, and test their functionality by playing media and displaying device details.
