//You are developing a simple payroll system for a company. The company has different types of employees, including full-time employees and part-time employees. Each employee is paid based on their specific type, and the calculation may vary depending on whether the employee is full-time or part-time.
//Implement polymorphism to handle the calculation of pay for different types of employees.
// Define a superclass called Employee with common attributes such as employee ID and name, and a method calculatePay()
// to calculate the pay for an employee. Then, create two subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that inherit
// from the Employee class. Each subclass should override the calculatePay() method to provide the specific
// pay calculation for full-time and part-time employees, respectively.
//An Employee class with attributes for employee ID and name, and a method calculatePay()
//to calculate the pay for an employee. A FullTimeEmployee class that inherits from the Employee class and
//overrides the calculatePay() method to calculate the pay for a full-time employee.
//A PartTimeEmployee class that inherits from the Employee class and overrides the calculatePay()
//method to calculate the pay for a part-time employee. A Main class to demonstrate the functionality
//of these classes by creating objects of FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee and calling their calculatePay()
//methods.
