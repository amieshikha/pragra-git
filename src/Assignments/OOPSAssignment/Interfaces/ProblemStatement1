/* Create an interface Animal with methods feed() and makeSound() to represent basic animal
behaviors. Create interfaces for specific behaviors, such as Swimmable with methods swim() for aquatic
animals and Climbable with methods climb() for animals that can climb. Implement classes for different animal
types (e.g., Lion, Penguin, Monkey) that implement the relevant interfaces. Each animal type should exhibit
its unique behaviors, such as a lion roaring and a penguin swimming. Design the architecture to allow the
addition of new animal types with minimal code changes.*/
